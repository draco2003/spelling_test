Childrens Spelling list tester

ToDo:
- Switch to React
- Make navigation and State less wonky. (hoping react handles this better)
- Remove ugly textarea and switch to input box + editable list, like the typical React "ToDo List" examples
- Add Skip button to test
- Show Results (X of Y correct) after test
